# To Do App 1 - JS

1. Choose day and add new list.

2. You can change day label to any text you type.

3. Each day/list contains 2 types of tasks: important and normal tasks.

4. Each task status can be set to "In progress" (yellow) and "Prio" (red).

5. Each task text can be changed.

6. You can drag and drop every task between days/lists and you can move them up and down in the current list.

7. You can drag and drop every day/list - just grab list label and drag it onto another list label.

8. Every task/day/list you drag and drop is inserted before target item.

9. When you have few days/lists horizontal scrollbar will be shown. You can drag the page for faster scrolling. 

10. Every change is saved to Local Storage and loaded when page is loaded. Save feature is based on mainContainer innerHTML.

11. You can backup you data to text file and load data from that file.

12. If you load data from file you have to do something on the list (e.g. add new task, edit or move item etc.) to save data to Local Storage. There is no auto-save just after file loads - when you load wrong file, the page crashes - in that case just reload the page to get your previous data or to load new file.
